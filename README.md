### Welcome to the open-source repository for all experiments found in the paper:

_Philippos Papaphilippou, Myrtle Shah "FPGA-extended General Purpose Computer Architecture" The 18th International Symposium on Applied Reconfigurable Computing (ARC) 2022_

This is a research paper exploring a novel FPGA-extended computer architecture, where small FPGAs are used to implement instructions inside general-purpose processors (CPUs). Click [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.10359.pdf) for a preprint.

The following content placeholders are going to be eventually populated (at least before the conference on the 19th of September):

1. Softcore framework (Simodense (RV32IM) extended with "F" (RV32IMF) and "Zicsr")
2. The ported benchmarks (Embench with F) and operating system (FreeRTOS)
3. The FPGA architecture model (nextpnr experiment)
4. Intel PIN experiments for opcode characterisation
